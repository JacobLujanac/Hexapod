# function to determine movement goal
  # factor in
    # target state (comes from path planning algorithim)
    # current state


## assign which legs will make up each tripod

## The type of movement will be determined
## The angles for each joint will be determined based off of the type of move
## Will have to change the sign of the angle depending on if its on the left or right sides
## This will update the servo.SetDegree (which is the next degree that the legs are moving to)
